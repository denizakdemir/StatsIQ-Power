"""
Statistical Power Calculations for Mixed Effects Models.

Includes placeholders for:
- Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMM)
- Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models (GLMM)

Note: Power calculations for mixed models are complex and typically require
simulation based on the specific model structure (fixed effects, random effects,
variance components, correlation structures). Analytical solutions are rare.
