"""
Statistical Power Calculations for Multivariate Methods.

Includes placeholders for:
- Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA)
- Discriminant Analysis
- Factor Analysis
- Cluster Analysis

Note: Power analysis for multivariate methods is complex and often depends
on specific hypotheses (e.g., overall test, specific discriminant functions,
number of factors, cluster separation). Simulation is frequently required.
