"""
Statistical Power Calculations for Time Series Analysis.

Includes placeholders for:
- ARIMA Models
- Intervention Analysis

Note: Power analysis for time series models is complex and depends heavily
on the model parameters (AR/MA orders, differencing), the magnitude of the
effect or intervention, and the length of the series. Simulation is often required.
